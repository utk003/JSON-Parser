/**
 * The traditional JSON parsing package provides utilities for converting JSON
 * into a tree with {@link io.github.utk003.json.traditional.node.JSONValue} nodes.
 * <p>
 * The specific node types can all be found in {@link io.github.utk003.json.traditional.node},
 * and the associated parser class is {@link io.github.utk003.json.traditional.JSONParser}.
 * <p>
 * For more advanced "Object-Oriented" JSON parsing, check out the
 * {@link io.github.utk003.json.ooj} package. To translate from traditional
 * parsing results to OOJ, use {@link io.github.utk003.json.ooj.OOJTranslator}.
 *
